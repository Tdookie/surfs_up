## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
Here we analyzed weather data contained in hawaii.sqlite using SQLAlchemy. This dataset includes temperature and precipitation measurements in Hawaii from 2010 to 2017 summarized in two tables: measurement including the station, date, and the recorded precipitation and temperature, along with station including geographic coordinates and elevation. In this analysis we query and summarize key differences in Hawaii weather data between the months of December and June.
